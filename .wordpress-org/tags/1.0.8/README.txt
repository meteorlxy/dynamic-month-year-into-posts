== Description ==

Add today's date by [date], current year by [year], previous year by [pyear], next year by [nyear] and current month by [month] shortcodes anywhere, including content and title. Use this plugin to boost your site's SEO by using the variables anywhere. Supports RankMath and [year] works as a replacement to %currentyear%, [month] as a replacement to %currentmonth% already.

Use various combinations to make your articles even more dynamic.

Supports Rank Math, Rank Math Pro, SEOPress, SEOPress Premium and Yoast SEO, Yoast SEO Premium. Tested to be working with Yoast SEO, SEOPress and Rank Math's breadcrumbs, custom meta titles, excerpt etc.

*How to use?*
Just install the plugin (see Installation tab) and activate it. Add [year] to render current year, [nyear] to render next year, [pyear] to render previous year and [month] to render current month automatically. As the months & years change, they get updated into the content and title automatically on the shortcode locations.

**Rankmath** SEO plugin is (very) recommended but not required.
