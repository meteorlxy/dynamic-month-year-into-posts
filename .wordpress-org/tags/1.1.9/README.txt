### Automate your SEO

Add today's date by `[date]`, current year by `[year]`, previous year by `[pyear]`, next year by `[nyear]`, current month (like January) by `[month]` and current month shortname (like Jan) by `[mon]` shortcodes anywhere, including content and title. Use this plugin to boost your site's SEO by using the variables anywhere.

As the months & years change, these shortcodes get updated into the content and title automatically on the shortcode locations.
