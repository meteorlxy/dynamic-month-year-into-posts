## Description

Add current year by [year] and current month by [month] shortcodes anywhere, including content and title. Use this plugin to boost your site's SEO by using the variables anywhere. Supports RankMath and [year] works as a replacement to %currentyear%, [month] as a replacement to %currentmonth% already.

Supports even the Rank Math's breadcrumbs, custom meta titles, excerpt etc.

## How to use?

Just install the plugin (see Installation tab) and activate it. Add [year] to render current year, [nyear] to render next year, [pyear] to render previous year and [month] to render current month automatically. As the months & years change, they get updated into the content and title automatically on the shortcode locations.

**Rankmath** SEO plugin is (very) recommended but not required.
