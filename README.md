## Description

### Automate your SEO

Add today's date by `[date]`, current year by `[year]`, previous year by `[pyear]`, next year by `[nyear]`, current month (like January) by `[month]`, next month (like February) by `[nmonth]`, previous month (like December) by `[pmonth]`, current/next/previous month shortname (like Jan, Feb and Dec) by `[mon]`, `[nmon]` & `[pmon]` shortcodes anywhere, including content and title. Uses your default WordPress language. Use this plugin to boost your site's SEO, automate your affiliate marketing, automatically updating blogging lists, offer dynamic coupon expiries and more, just by using these variables anywhere.

### Works with popular SEO Plugins

* Supports RankMath, Yoast and SEOPress plugins and can be used to replace all their date based variables.
* `[year]` works as a replacement to `%currentyear%` , `[month]` as a replacement to `%currentmonth%` already.
* Use various combinations to make your articles even more dynamic and make your content always SEO ready â€” no matter the date or year.
* Extremely useful for Affiliate Marketers, Amazon Affiliates and Copywriters.

Tested to be totally working with Yoast SEO, SEOPress and Rank Math's breadcrumbs, custom meta titles, excerpt etc.

Note: Since August 2021, Google has started showing h1 titles in search results, this plugin becomes even more useful as no other SEO plugins adds Current Month, Current Year or Today's Date in h1 titles except this; keeping the same in SEO meta as well.

### Easy to use

Just install the plugin (see Installation tab) and activate it.

As the months & years change, these shortcodes get updated into the content and title automatically on the shortcode locations.

Zero bloat. No CSS/JS files loaded. No database queries are made and the content is rendered on-the-fly. I am a performance geek myself, so I understand what you need.
